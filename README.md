FermentationJSON
================

Standardized JSON Objects for Beer Brewing, Wine Making and Realted Software.

Why parse XML files when you can load JSON objects?

Will include formats for: Recipes, Inventory, Grains, Extracts, Hops, Yeast, Water, Beer Styles, Brewing Equipment, Mash Profiles, and more...

(Inspired by BeerXML.)

Using [JSONSchema](http://json-schema.org/) via [Orderly](http://orderly-json.org/).
